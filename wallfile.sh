Wall are made of stone, sand and cement.
They are impenetrable.
Though i have read and heard that some people can pass through walls
These normally have the spirit of the living God resident in them.
They are those who are born again or saved.
They can do anything they believe their God for.
For them, everything is possible.
Its amazing to live with and commune with them.
Positivity comes easy for them.
And actually,thats what moves everything down here, POSITIVE ENERGY.
