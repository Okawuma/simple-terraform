Walls are made of stone, sand and cement.
They are impenetrable.
Though i have read and heard that some people can pass through walls
These people normally have the spirit of the living God resident in them. Mark my words, "normally"
They are those who are born again or saved and have been redeemed by the blood of the living God.
They can do anything they believe their God for.
For them, everything is possible.
Its amazing to live with and commune with them.
Positivity comes easy for them.
And actually,thats what moves everything down here, POSITIVE ENERGY.
